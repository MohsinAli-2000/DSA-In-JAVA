--->>>>>> FIRST DAY OF DSA WRITTING PSEOUDO CODE FOR PROBLEMS <<<<<<-------


--->>> Pseudo Code for finding leap year--->>>
1- Divide the year with 4 if not divisible then its not a leap year.
2- If number is divisble by 4, check if it is not divisble by 100 its a leap year.
3- If it is divisble by 100, check whether it  is also divisble by 400.
4- If divisble also by 400 then its a leap year, else its not a leap year.

--->>> Take two numbers and print the sum of both--->>>
1- Take the num1 from the user and store it in a varibale.
2- Take the num2 from the user and store it in a variable.
3- Assign the sum of these two variable to a third a variable
4- Now print the value  of third variable.

---->>> Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it--->>>
1- Take a number from user and save it in variable.
2- Now declare an other variable and set its value to 1.
3- Declare a third variable and store the product of above two variables and print it and after each operation add 1 into the multiplier i.e that is second variable.
4- Print the table upto number you want and exit the loop.

--->>> Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM--->>>
1- First of all take two numbers from the user and store each one in a variable.
2- Now divide the both of them on each number starting from 1.
3- Print the highest divisor whose remainder is 0 that is HCF.
4- Now to find the LCM multiply the two given numbers and divide their product with HCF.
5- Print out the HCF and LCM.


--->>>Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all--->>>
1- Declare  two varible and assign value of 0 to the second one.
2- Now take the number as a input form the user.
3- If user enter a number add that to the second varibale and ask for another input.
4- If user enter "x" then print the value of second variable.
